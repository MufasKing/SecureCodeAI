    Scans a string from the standard input, securely storing it in a buffer.
    
    The scan function reads in a string from the standard input, limiting the number of characters
    read to prevent buffer overflow. The scanned string is securely stored in a buffer, preventing
    memory disclosure or manipulation. The function returns the number of characters read, excluding
    the newline character, or -1 if an error occurs.
    
    This function is designed to be secure and prevent common security vulnerabilities such as
    buffer overflow, memory disclosure, and input validation errors.
